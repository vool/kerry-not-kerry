# Kerry not Kerry


Firefox add-on which replaces all references in webpages to John Kerry with County Kerry


For Mr. Williams...

> I'm tempted to edit one of these articles so that the county Kerry replaces John Kerry and any picture of John Kerry is replaced with a picture of the kerry football team or a map of kerry. I've a feeling that it is the sort of pointless shenanigans that you would be into too. Any idea what we could do with one of these edited articles for a bit of entertainment?
