# Kerry not Kerry


Firefox add-on which replaces all references in webpages to John Kerry with County Kerry


For Mr. Williams...

> I'm tempted to edit one of these articles so that the county Kerry replaces John Kerry and any picture of John Kerry is replaced with a picture of the kerry football team or a map of kerry. I've a feeling that it is the sort of pointless shenanigans that you would be into too. Any idea what we could do with one of these edited articles for a bit of entertainment?


## Packaging

You can download the script I use to package .xpi's here -> [xpimaker](https://gist.github.com/vool/cd48c7bf96af141638bd#file-xpimaker-sh)
then you can run:

    ./xpimaker.sh kerry-not-kerry src
